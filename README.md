Grassmannians and universal coefficients for cluster algebras

The following are the files for a homepage that contains all information about the Grassmannian Gr(3,6) and its cluster embedding. 
Please download all files to one folder and then open the file index.html in your favorite browser.

On the homepage you can find computational data regarding what we call the cluster embedding of the Grassmannain Gr(3,6), 
the description of a particular maximal cone in the Gröbner fan of its defining ideal, 
the toric initial ideals corresponding to faces of the maximal cone that are induced by seeds, 
the flat family associated to the maximal cone, and a description of the cluster algebra with universal coefficients A3,6univ

For the computations we used the computer program Macaulay2, B. Keller's Quiver Mutation App, and polymake.
Any kind of comments, remarks or questions regarding the homepage or the paper are very much appreciated.
